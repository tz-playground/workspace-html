# workspace-html

This project now includes a static HTML page, the latest versions of all declared development dependencies, and supports page preview. The introduction of a `package.json` file ensures that all necessary development dependencies are declared and up-to-date. Additionally, the project is configured to support page preview through a local development server, enhancing the development experience.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, ensuring they are the latest versions, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Running the Development Server

To preview the static HTML page with live reloading, use the following command to start the development server:

```
npm start
```

This will open the page in your default web browser and automatically reload it whenever changes are made to the source files.
