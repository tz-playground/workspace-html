## Using Vite for Page Previews

To preview your pages during development, you can use Vite, a modern front-end build tool. It provides a fast development environment with hot module replacement (HMR).

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
2. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
3. Open your browser to the URL provided in the terminal to view your page.

Vite will automatically reload the page when changes are made to your files, allowing for a seamless development experience.

### Previewing Pages Without Auto-Open

To preview your pages without Vite automatically opening them in your browser:

1. Ensure you have Vite installed by following the "Getting Started" instructions.
2. Use the command `npm run preview` to start the Vite preview server.
3. Manually navigate to the provided URL in your browser to view your page.

This setup allows you to control when and how you view your page previews.
